# Evaluation Script Code for Master Thesis

## Overview
This folder contains the evaluation scripts used in my master thesis.
These scripts are designed to connect to the pipeline database and generate the result graphics and facts presented in the thesis.
The primary script, [runAll.py](./runAll.py), orchestrates the execution of the other scripts to produce comprehensive evaluation results.

## Folder Structure
- `runAll.py`: Main script that runs all other evaluation scripts.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for the evaluation environment.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration to set up this container.
- `file_cache.py`: A file caching system gotten from [here](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/docs/public/file_cache.py) to speedup development.

## Prerequisites
* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Setup Instructions
1. Build and Run the Docker Containers
Ensure you are in the this directory, where the docker-compose.yml file is located, then run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Running the Evaluation Script
Once the Docker containers are up and running, execute the main script:
```bash
docker exec -it your-container-name python3 runAll.py
```
Replace your-container-name with the actual name of the container running the evaluation environment.

## Configuration
The connection to the pipeline database and other configuration settings are defined in the [dbConnection.py](./dbConnection.py) file.
Modify these settings as necessary to match your database credentials and other configurations.

## Output
The results generated by the evaluation scripts will be stored in the [figures](./figures/) directory.
